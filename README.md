- You may use any web technologies you deem suitable to acomplish this build.
- You do not need to worry about older versions of any browsers.

## Getting Started
To get started with this build, fork this repository into your own public repo. once you have completed the build, commit your work and send the URL of your repository to us via email with the subject line 'OAM Tech Test'.

If however, you are not comfortable using github, you can download the files as a Zip archive (click the green code button on the right hand side and it will give you an option to 'download ZIP') . After completing your build, please re-archive the files you wish to send and share the ZIP archive via email using services such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

For the purposes of this tech test we have decided to use a basic wire-frame mockup, the overall design is intentionally basic to ensure that the applicant can be confident that we are not simply using them to produce work for us without pay!
